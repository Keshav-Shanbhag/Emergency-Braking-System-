# Requirements
## Introduction
 -The project aims to design and develop the vehicle with emergency braking system to avoid collision.
 -It senses the obstacle in the environment using ultrasonic sensor and send input to Raspberry Pi.
 -It sends a mail and sms about locationof the vehicle to the nearest Police station where the accident happened.

## Research
 -In 1996,Merceds-Benz became the first company to make Brake Assist standard equipment on all its models.
 -In 2007,European commision announced that it wanted Brake Assit to be included on all new models sold in the EU .
 - This brake assist regulation is not used in the united states because the unitd states do not use UNECE regulations.
 
## Cost and Features and Timeline
--Cost
  The system can be adopted in any vehicle and less costs.

--Features
   System comes with autonomous braking system with feature to send sms/mail alert to nearby police
   station if any oposite vehicle hits the system.
--Timeline
   System can work with all models of vehicles and different road types.

## Defining Our System
    The main purpose is to design the automatic braking system in order to avoid the accident.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
#Strength
--avoids collision
--send alert to help

#Weakness
--Accident happens if opposite vehicle hits.

#Opportunity
--Helps to reduce Accidents

#Threats
--If any obstacles other than front,system not detects obstacles.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

--For Driver who cannot able to control vehicle in some circumstances.

## What:

--Emergency Braking system helps to avoid accidents of vehicle when Driver cannot control vehicle.

## When:

--It used in cases where Driver fails to apply brakes and finds obstacles ,then this system will stop the vehicle.

## Where:

--Used in the vehicle to avoid accidents.

## How:

--This system finds front obstacles and if driver wont apply brakes ,immediately vehicle gets stopped.This prevents collision.
