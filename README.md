# Emergency-Braking-System-


Traffic accidents in India are a major source of deaths, injuries and property damage
every year. According to Economic Times, more than 150,000 people are killed each
year in traffic accidents in India. Thatâ€™s about 400 fatalities a day and far higher than
developed auto markets like the US. Various national and international researchers
have found that the most common behavior of road drivers, which leads to accident,
includes: over speeding, drunken driving, distractions to driver, red light jumping,
avoiding safety gears like seat belts, and non-adherence to lane driving and
overtaking in a wrong manner.


According to Economic Times, speeding caused almost 67 per cent of road
accidents, which indicates that a special attention is required by manufacturers to
incorporate a system that regulates speed. Globally, manufacturers do not usually
add such safety systems until and unless they were forced to do so by mandatory
government regulations.


The proposed project aims to design and develop an automatic braking system to
minimize the chances of any accidents due to over speeding or any of above
reasons. The proposed system regulates speed through automatic braking in cases
where a driver fails to apply breaks at the right time in order to prevent or minimizes
the accidents. The proposed system uses Raspberry PI as main component for
controlling a vehicle. The system also uses sensors to detect any disaster within the
vicinity and issue a warning to limit the speed to a safe level. However, the system
automatically regulates speed when the speed is not limited to safe level. Additional
features like sharing accidents locations with the nearest police stations through
email or sms.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Initially system fails in dirty roads because of friction->More Power Used for Motors
2. If system hits by other vehicle not having Emergency Braking system->Mail/sms to nearby Police Station about accdient
